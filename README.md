This is a game directed towards the Windows platform. It is a two player version of pong. It was my first Windows application and it gave me a taste of C# development. I look forward to continue programming on this platform.

My application can be ran on Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2010. It makes use of the XNA version 4.0 sdk. In order to check out my game one should clone my repository and open up my project file located in game/game/game. From here you can run my game from within Visual Studio.
